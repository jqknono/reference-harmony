      "body": "• Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, feat, fix, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope,\n\nOPTIONAL !, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.\n\n• The type feat MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.\n• The type fix MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.\n• A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded\n\nby parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser):\n\n• A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short\n\nsummary of the code changes, e.g., fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string.\n\n• A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about\n\nthe code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.\n\n• A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.\n• One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed\n\nby either a :<space> or <space># separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the\n[git trailer convention](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers)).\n\n• A footer’s token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., Acked-by (this helps differentiate the footer\n\nsection from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE, which MAY also be used as a token.\n\n• A footer’s value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer\n\ntoken/separator pair is observed.\n\n• Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.\n• If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon,\n\nspace, and description, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files.\n\n• If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a ! immediately before the :. If ! is\n\nused, BREAKING CHANGE: MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe\nthe breaking change.\n\n• Types other than feat and fix MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., docs: update ref docs.\n• The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with\n\nthe exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.\n\n• BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer."
